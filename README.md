Welcome to my repository, where I am utilizing the power of React, Styled Components, and React-Hook-Forms to create dynamic and visually appealing web applications. I was in the new on Styled Components, and while my journey with it may still be messy as proven on this project, I'm constantly learning and improving.

One of the highlights of this repository is the custom hook I've created called 'useMultistep', designed specifically for multi-step forms. This hook was developed as a result of my exploration into the world of custom hooks, and it's a direct reflection of my five-month-long journey learning from various YouTube tutorials.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository, and I hope you find the code here helpful and informative. Let's continue to learn and grow together in the world of React and Styled Components.

And in this repository, I have chosen to use Vite instead of Webpack as my development tool. This choice was made because Vite is a fast and efficient alternative to traditional bundlers like Webpack. It boasts instant dev server setup, faster build times, and lower memory usage, making it an ideal choice for modern web development.

Additionally, Vite focuses on only bundling the necessary parts of this application, providing a faster and more optimized build process. This leads to a better user experience, as this application loads faster and consumes fewer resources.

By using Vite, I am able to streamline my development process, and create high-performance web applications with ease.
